## What does this project do?
Slipbox.io is a note storage system inspired by the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). It stores notes, links between notes, and sources for the notes. Slipbox.io makes using this system simple, convenient and fun while unlocking the benefits of using a Zettelkasten note storage system. Slipbox.io will also visualize the contents of your slipbox helping to find patterns that exist in the tree of notes that is a slipbox.

The project is designed for the desktop browser. During a session, you can record notes, links between notes, and source summaries for the notes. After a session, a file called slipbox.json is produced. To continue with the slipbox, the same file should be loaded into the next session.

## Why is this project useful?
This note storage system gives a systematic approach to learning and knowledge storage. Using this system helps our own memory recall. It guides us into putting things into our own words and applying them to our previous knowledge, each of which make it easier to remember information. This structure pushes us towards the formation of complex ideas, linking simple ideas together, to create powerful ideas. This system is simple and encouraging. It illuminates where we have critical masses of knowledge and where we may not know as much.

## How do I get started?
The project is available [here](https://varunbhoopalam.github.io/slipbox/).

## How do I contribute?
At this time, the project is not set up for collaboration. Please reach out if you have something to discuss or want from this project. If there is interest, I would love to collaborate and perhaps bring on other contributors as a result. 

Another option to contribute is to fill out issues with bugs, feature requests and the like.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

## Vision

I imagine a foundation set up to host people's data for free if they want to use this system from any device. Similarly, a solution is set up on any device to access and add notes or explore your own slipbox. Further, I think expanding the capabilities of the system, especially ways of collaborating, sensemaking, and sharing knowledge should be possible.

## Why open source?

This project was open sourced for multiple reasons. One is transparency. It is important that nothing is hidden about what is happening while the software is working. To this point, the project has been driven by what I would find convenient and useful in a note taking system. If it should get wider use from others, I believe it will start to move in different directions than I am able to anticipate. This is another reason for open sourcing the project. I want to make it open to more perspectives than my own should anyone else find this project useful.
