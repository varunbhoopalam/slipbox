## What does this project do?
Slipbox.io is a note storage system inspired by the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). This software is intended to make note storage simple, convenient, and fun while unlocking the benefits of using a Zettelkasten note storage system. The project is designed for the desktop browser. During a session, you can record notes, links between notes, and source summaries for the notes. After a session, a file called slipbox.json is produced. To continue with the slipbox, the same file should be loaded into the next session.

## Why is this project useful?
This project is useful to make the Zettelkasten system more accessible and unlock insights from the notes through visualization software. 

## How do I get started?
The project is available [here](https://varunbhoopalam.github.io/slipbox/).

We learn many things every single day. When I research something specific, I learn things about it. I also learn 20 things unrelated to my initial inquiry but related to my overall knowledge base. These learnings should not go to waste! I suggest building habits around the slipbox to take advantage of our capacity to learn and situations like the ones I described. Read with a pen in hand. Keep notes of what you find interesting in the day but put it into your own words. Make summaries of what you took from your reading. Pick a time of day to record these things in your slipbox and work with it for 15-30 minutes each day. This will increase your memory recall by applying new knowledge to previous knowledge and understanding concepts independent of their context. This will also help show you where you have vast amounts of knowlege where critical masses of notes build up. Most importantly, this should be fun and effortless! Especially when you build the habits to do these and they are second nature. When we have critical masses of knowledge we are better equiped to solve questions that we have and take advantage of the knowledge. It sounds pretty fun to me to only do what we feel like doing in the moment and at the same time build up our arsenals of knowledge and increase our own memory at the same time.

The slipbox is intended as a note storage app, not a note taking app. 

## How do I contribute?
At this time, the project is not set up for collaboration. Please reach out if you have something to discuss or want from this project. If there is interest, I would love to collaborate and perhaps bring on other contributors as a result. 

Another option to contribute is to fill out issues with bugs, feature requests and the like.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

## Vision

I imagine a foundation set up to host people's data for free if they want to use this system from any device. Similarly, a solution is set up on any device to access and add notes or explore your own slipbox. Further, I think expanding the capabilities of the system, especially ways of collaborating, sensemaking, and sharing knowledge should be possible.

## Why open source?

This project was open sourced for multiple reasons. One is transparency. It is important that nothing is hidden about what is happening while the software is working. To this point, the project has been driven by what I would find convenient and useful in a note taking system. If it should get wider use from others, I believe it will start to move in different directions than I am able to anticipate. This is another reason for open sourcing the project. I want to make it open to more perspectives than my own should anyone else find this project useful.
