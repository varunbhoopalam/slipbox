# slipbox - external mind storage
We learn so much everyday but much of our knowledge goes to waste. We know more than we realize. We cannot remember everything we know, when we need to know it. Slipbox transforms this wasted knowledge into action. The more we learn, the more powerful we become. The practice of slipbox makes you powerful, and harnassing it grows your knowledge exponentially. It becomes easier to remember what you need to know, when you need to know it. Our critical masses of knowledge turn into publications, companies, and projects! You get to decide how to harness your power.

The slipbox is an application with daily practice. It is a funnel that captures everything we learn and converts it into something useful to us. This system is based on psychological research and study.

## What does this project do?
This is a note storage system inspired by the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). It is an external mind storage that you can think inside of. It stores notes, links between notes, and sources for the notes. Slipbox makes using this system simple, convenient and fun while unlocking the benefits of using a Zettelkasten note storage system. Slipbox will also visualize the contents of your slipbox helping to find patterns that exist in the tree of notes that is a slipbox. [Here](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph) is an example of what that might look like. 

The project is designed for the desktop browser. During a session you can record notes, links between notes, and source summaries for the notes. The explore tab is designed to visualize what's inside of your slipbox. The notes and sources tabs are for text views of what is inside of your slipbox. After a session, a file called slipbox.json is produced. To continue with the slipbox, the same file should be loaded into the next session.

## Why is this project useful?
This note storage system gives a systematic approach to learning and knowledge storage. Using this system helps our own memory recall. It guides us into putting things into our own words and applying them to our previous knowledge, each of which make it easier to remember information. This structure pushes us towards the formation of complex ideas, linking simple ideas together, to create powerful ideas. This system is simple and encouraging. It illuminates where we have critical masses of knowledge and where we may not know as much.

#### Specific example use cases for specific personas
- **Authors and scholars can identify topics and arguments for their next publication.** By adding to a slipbox you can see where you have critical masses of knowledge. These critical masses can turn into publications!
- **Entrepreneurs and creators can identify opportunities for innovation.** The practice of putting new knowledge into our own words to strengthen memory recall also highlights our [Epistemic Dependence](https://msu.edu/~orourk51/860-Phil/Handouts/Readings/Hardwig-EpistemicDependence-JPhil-1985.pdf). This phenomenon shows our reliance on other's knowledge and highlights how little we actually understand about things in some cases. This practice can identify gaps in our understanding. This is a great thing! By questioning our assumptions, we can identify what we actually know and question what we do not. We can then link notes/concepts to the assumptions that we are questioning and start to build powerful, complex theories with solid bases. This is how innovation happens!
- **Anyone who is curious about the world can map out the knowledge they have and explore areas for further discovery!"** Areas of knowledge that are lacking in our external mind maps become a lot more obvious through use of the slipbox. This persona can take this insight and use it for inspiration on what to do or research next.

## How do I get started?

#### Steps
1. Navigate to the project. The project is available [here](https://varunbhoopalam.github.io/slipbox/).
2. Click start new slipbox
3. Scroll down to the workspace and click create a note button. Add a note by filling in the content and source and then hitting the submit button that pops up.
4. If you have a source associated to the note, click the create source button and fill out the form.
5. Click the create question button and submit a question that you want to answer! This can be your entry point when referencing the slipbox for projects that you have going on.
6. If your question and note are related, create a link between them by clicking the add link button on one of the notes or questions. If you dismissed them from the workspace, you can open them in the workspace by finding them on the graph in the explore tab or clicking on them in the notes tab.
7. Save your work by clicking save in the top right corner. You'll use this file next time when you return to add new notes to the slipbox.

#### Tips
- Slipbox works with local files on a computer! If you're on a public or shared computer, email the file to yourself so you can pick up where you left off.
- Create backups of your slipbox file in cloud storage so you're able to recover work should the original file go missing. This also lets you use another computer to add to your note storage.

#### Workflow suggestions
- Throughout the day keep your mind open! Be an active and engaged listener and reader! Keep notes that interest you in a place that is convenient for you to access! I personally use a notes app on my phone.
- Pick a time to use slipbox at the beginning or end of the day and spend 15 minutes every day you can working with it! At your designated time, transfer your notes from where you stored the notes throughout the day to your slipbox note storage.
- I believe this practice will unlock the benefits of using the system in the first place while also being fun to use! This practice will not be invasive, and it allows you to have freedom in your day to do what you want to do; it does not force you to live in the app.

## How do I contribute?
At this time, the project is not set up for collaboration. Please reach out if you have something to discuss or want from this project. If there is interest, I would love to collaborate and perhaps bring on other contributors as a result. 

Another option to contribute is to fill out issues with bugs, feature requests and the like.

## Vision

I imagine a foundation set up to host people's data for free if they want to use this system from any device. Similarly, a solution is set up on any device to access and add notes or explore your own slipbox. Further, I think expanding the capabilities of the system, especially ways of collaborating, sensemaking, and sharing knowledge should be possible.

## Why open source?

This project was open sourced for multiple reasons. One is transparency. It is important that nothing is hidden about what is happening while the software is working. To this point, the project has been driven by what I would find convenient and useful in a note taking system. If it should get wider use from others, I believe it will start to move in different directions than I am able to anticipate. This is another reason for open sourcing the project. I want to make it open to more perspectives than my own should anyone else find this project useful.
